In this project, I built a miniature car-robot using an arduino mega and four DC motors. I tried to control the motor using different ways.
//first configuration:    It follows the light using 2 LDRs (Light Dependent Resistor).
//Second configuration:   It follows a certain pattern, we calculate the turn angle and speed, then we code the pattern we want to achieve on the arduino IDE
//Third configuration:    Using a ultrasonic sensor, we coded the robot to check for obstacles using a servo motor, we turn the ultrasonic sensor 180 degrees to
                        look for the best the best road to take.

Enjoy!
